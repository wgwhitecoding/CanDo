# UX - User Experience

## Design Inspiration
For the Kanban Board Project, my design inspiration was drawn from popular productivity tools like Trello, Slack, and Notion. These platforms are renowned for their vibrant and dynamic color palettes, which I sought to incorporate into my project to create a sense of familiarity and connectivity for users.

I was enthusiastic about developing the frontend of this project because I had a clear vision of the final product from the outset. The goal was to design a clean, modern interface that balances plenty of whitespace with colorful, eye-catching icons for each section of the website. This approach ensures that important elements stand out, making the user experience both intuitive and visually appealing.

The colors chosen were very specific and intentional, aimed at evoking a sense of energy, creativity, and organization. I meticulously applied CSS styling to ensure that each section of the site carried through the relevant colors consistently. The color scheme is inspired by the palettes used in Trello, Slack, and Notion, which are effective in creating an engaging and productive environment.

The logo itself is a deliberate blend of colors found in the productivity tools mentioned, creating a cohesive and recognizable brand identity for the Kanban Board Project.

By drawing inspiration from these successful tools, I aimed to develop an interactive and service-oriented website that not only meets the functional needs of users but also provides an enjoyable and motivating user experience.

## color Scheme

As mentioned above The colour scheme for the Kanban Board Project is meticulously designed to evoke a sense of energy, creativity, and organization.
